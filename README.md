# Watts Vision for Home Assistant

These are my first steps in creating an add on for home assistant and learning python. There's a lot left to do and its not an efficient way of collecting the data but I'm learning by doing. Please be kind.

## Installation

Copy the watts_vision folder from custom_components to your custom_components folder of your home assistant instance.

Add the following lines to configuration.yaml

```
watts_vision:
  username: [username]
  password: [password]
```
